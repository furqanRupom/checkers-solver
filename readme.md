# 🎯Checkers Solver

A **Checkers (Draughts)** game built using **Python**, **Pygame**, and **NumPy** — where the computer plays naturally like a real person instead of acting like a perfect engine.

***

## 🧠 What Makes It Special

Unlike typical AI checkers games, this one doesn’t feel robotic.
The built-in solver **“humanizes”** its moves by:

- Thinking for a few seconds before playing.
- Occasionally making small mistakes (blunders).
- Hesitating or changing its mind at times.
- Adapting its difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) realistically.

It’s meant to feel like you’re playing against a thoughtful human opponent.
